## ArduinoMega
Arduino code for making simple patterns. Not controlled by serial. 

## ArduinoMega_serial
An extension of the above code, including listning to serial so a PC, the Pioneer LX or Raspberry Pi can send commands to the Arduino. The PC, Pioneer or Raspberry should be able to set light mode, connect to the MEA server, and send MEA recordings to the Arduino.

## nodeMCU_serial
Arduino code for the nodeMCU ESP8266 (currently replaced by the Arduino Mega) developed by EiT.

## Other information
### Trouble uploading to Arduino in Linux
If you have access trouble when updating code to your Arduino within Linux, you have to set USB privlages in terminal:
```
$ sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0
```
### Connecting to MEA server
The [MEAME](https://github.com/PeterAaser/MEAME) server running on the Windows machine at Ã˜ya communicates directly with the MultichannelSystems MEA2100 hardware. There is currently no API for this server, so the user must get familier with the code.

Hierarchy: Program.cs (main) -> MeaForm.cs -> MeaInterfaces.cs -> TcpServer.cs  
Dependency: [McsUsbNet.dll](http://www.multichannelsystems.com/software/mcsusbnetdll)
